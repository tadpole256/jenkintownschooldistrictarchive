<h1>The UNOFFICIAL Jenkintown School District Archive</h1>
</div>
<p>This page is hosted on GitHub, and it is intended to serve as a public resource. This site is in no way affiliated with the actual School District of Jenkintown.</p>
<p>Our local school district makes a wide variety of resources available online on their website. However, they sometimes remove or update resources without public notice.</p>
<p>The sudden removal of announcements, policies, meeting notes, etc. can sometimes be problematic for members of the community. This is a community lead project to try to save a historical archive of as much of these documents as possible.</p>
<p>This site is currently a crude early-release. I will strive to update it and improve it as time and resources permit. Community input and crowd sourcing of documents is welcome and encouraged.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Please feel free to contact me and let me know what information YOU would find useful to have stored here, and have access to.</b> If you have additional materials/info not yet available here, please feel free to send it to me.</p>
<p>You can send requests, or share documents/info/material with me <a href="mailto:jsdcomments@nordalai.com">via e-mail here</a>, and comments/questions are always welcome.</p>
